== substruct.css

=== What is substruct.css?
Substruct is a CSS /structure/ (not a framework) that uses a simple mnemonic
for naming classes.

.Example
----
display: flex -> .di-fx
----

=== Features
* **1kb** max minified and gzipped.
* Simple and intuitive naming.
* Nothing extra; no colors, resets, grids, etc.


=== Naming
1. Property naming: First two letters of each word (e.g. `box-sizing-> bosi`)
2. Single word value naming: First two letters of each word.
3. Multi-word value naming: First letter of each word.
4. Single word conflicts: the next syllable is taken
   (e.g. `style -> sty-le -> sl`),
5. Multi-word conflicts: resolved by taking the next unique letter
   (e.g. `max-content -> mac, min-content -> mic`)

=== FAQ

** Because it makes read/writing CSS easier.
* Why aren't semi-useless or old properties included in substruct.css?

* How do I use substruct.css from other projects
** I recommend postcss-compose
* How is this different from Tachyons?
** substruct.css has file-per-property naming as in display properties are in display.css
** substruct.css has a somewhat sane naming scheme that can be inferred without looking
   up classes.
